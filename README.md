## Docker

```
docker pull icryo/epictreasure
docker run --rm -v /path/to/host/share/folder:/root/host-share --privileged -it --workdir=/root icryo/epictreasure
```

## Default settings
By default, [my dotfiles](http://github.com/ctfhacker/dotfiles) are installed onto the VM. Simply comment out the following lines in `Dockerfile` if you don't want my settings.

```
# Personal dotfiles
RUN cd /root && \
    rm .bashrc && \
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ctfhacker/dotfiles.git && \
    cd dotfiles && \
    ./install.sh
```

Then rebuild the Docker

```
docker build -t et .
```

#### Terminal
* Colorscheme for the terminal and vim is [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)

#### Vim
* `jk` or `jj` to `ESC` out of Vim 
* `ESC` and `Arrow keys` are hard coded to not work in Vim (as a teaching mechanism)
* `:` is remapped to `;` (who uses ; anyway?)
* leader key is `SPACE` (thanks to [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs))
* `SPACE p` will drop an embedded IPython line in a python script
* `H` moves to beginning of line, `L` moves to end of line (instead of `^` and `$`)

#### Tmux
* A new shell spawns a fresh `tmux` session
* `tmux` leader switched to `Ctrl+A`
* `Ctrl+A -` produces a horizontal pane. `Ctrl+A \` produces a vertical pane.
* `Ctrl+A [hjkl]` moves around available panes as vim motion
